# Lean Builder Support (Experimental)

This document provides information about using lean_builder with retrofit_generator.

## Status

⚠️ **Experimental** - Lean Builder support is currently under development and not yet recommended for production use.

## What is Lean Builder?

[Lean Builder](https://pub.dev/packages/lean_builder) is a streamlined Dart build system that offers:
- Fast incremental builds (often under 1 second)
- Parallel processing for maximum efficiency
- Watch mode with hot reload support
- Simple, declarative builder configuration

## Current Implementation

The infrastructure for lean_builder support has been added to retrofit_generator, but the full implementation is pending until:
1. Lean Builder reaches a stable release (currently at v0.1.2)
2. The retrofit_generator codebase is fully adapted to lean_builder's API

## Using build_runner (Recommended)

For now, please continue using build_runner for code generation:

```bash
# One-time build
dart pub run build_runner build

# Watch mode (recommended during development)
dart pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## Future Usage (When Available)

Once lean_builder support is fully implemented, you'll be able to use:

```bash
# One-time build
dart run lean_builder build

# Watch mode with hot reload
dart run lean_builder watch --dev
```

## Configuration

### pubspec.yaml

When lean_builder support is ready, your `pubspec.yaml` will include:

```yaml
dependencies:
  retrofit: ^4.6.0
  dio: ^5.0.0
  json_annotation: ^4.9.0

dev_dependencies:
  retrofit_generator: ^10.0.0
  lean_builder: ^0.1.2  # or latest version
  json_serializable: ^6.10.0
```

### build.yaml (Optional)

You can keep your existing `build.yaml` configuration. Lean Builder will respect these settings when support is fully implemented:

```yaml
targets:
  $default:
    builders:
      retrofit_generator:
        options:
          auto_cast_response: true
```

## Migration Path

When lean_builder support becomes stable:

1. **No code changes required** - Your @RestApi annotations and API definitions remain the same
2. **Update dependencies** - Add lean_builder to dev_dependencies
3. **Switch build command** - Use `dart run lean_builder build` instead of `build_runner`
4. **Enjoy faster builds** - Experience significantly faster incremental builds
